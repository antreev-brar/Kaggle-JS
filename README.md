# Playground for Jane Street Market Prediction Competition on Kaggle

# Ideas and notes
- Final sub: 1 with best public LB+CV, 1 experimental.
- submission idea: using different models for the `iter_env`, see if we can extract features representing general market trend, then switch/ensemble different models. Especially when the market is in volatile, the strategy in general needs to be more conservative.
-  `feature_64` may be used as time to build CV strategy. Ref: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/discussion/202253](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/discussion/202253)
- Number of trades `ts_id` might be related to volatility on that day: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/discussion/201930#1125847](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/discussion/201930#1125847)
- Another notebook on volatility (this one we should use its info at dicretion): [https://www.kaggle.com/charlesleahy/identifying-volatility-features](https://www.kaggle.com/charlesleahy/identifying-volatility-features)
- Two-Sigma's stock prediction competition (with a similar format) winning solution of 5th place: [https://medium.com/kaggle-blog/two-sigma-financial-modeling-code-competition-5th-place-winners-interview-team-best-fitting-279a493c76bd](https://medium.com/kaggle-blog/two-sigma-financial-modeling-code-competition-5th-place-winners-interview-team-best-fitting-279a493c76bd)
